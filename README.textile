h1. blokk

My blog, built with Camping. 318 lines of code.

h2. History

!{float: right; border: none}http://camping.rubyforge.org/Camping.gif!:http://camping.rubyforge.org/

I began writing the application that runs this blog on 2008-01-13, shortly after exploring "Camping":http://camping.rubyforge.org/, _why's extremely small web framework (which has only 4KB of code). I was amazed how easy it is to create a web application with it.

@blokk@ is derived from the "original blog.rb example":http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/camping/browser/trunk/examples/blog.rb.

Try it yourself! It's really fun to work with Camping - but only if you know "Ruby":http://ruby-lang.org.

The name derives simply from "my":http://murfy.de/murphy initials, KK.

h2. The Golden Rule of blokk

Somehow, I decided to keep @blokk@ at *318 lines of code* (that's without empty lines and comments).
318 is one of my favourite numbers (the other being 308).

h2. Download

* "blokk":http://murfy.de/blokk.rb - the application that you see running.
* "blokk in color":http://murfy.de/blokk.rb.html - highlighted with "CodeRay":http://coderay.rubychan.de.
* "feed":http://murfy.de/feed.rb - a 17-LOC library to simplify RSS feed generation (build on top of Ruby's "rss":http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/rss/rdoc/index.html lib.)
* "validate_size":http://murfy.de/validate_size.sh - counts the lines of code for blokk.rb. Returns 318.

h2. Development & Support

We have a "Redmine":http://code.licenser.net/projects/show/blokk project for blokk running on code.licenser.net.

h2. Planned features

* *Textile for comments* (I couldn't make it safe yet. The internet is a creepy place. Maybe with RedCloth 4?)
** *Preview for comments*: Textile will make it necessary.

h2. Features +not+ planned

* *Language detection*: -Would be really nice.- Most people seem to be annoyed by automatic language selection.
* *Search*: Just use "Google":http://www.google.com/search?q=site:murfy.de.
* *AJAX*: Although I like it very much, I want to keep this simple, also for visitors that have a slow connection or no eyes or whatever.
* *Preview for posts*: From my experience, I find most errors _after_ publishing an article anyway. If you ever see such an under-construction post, remember: This is Web 2.0 beta.
* Some kind of *pagination* and/or *archive* - I found out I don't need it! Everything I tag "Index" will be on the front page. Just tag older messages like "2008-01" or "old" to make an archive.
